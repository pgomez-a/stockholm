### What is ransomware?
**Ransomware** is a type of malware that **prevents users from accessing their system** or personal files and that requires the payment of a ransom to access them again. There are three main types of ransomware:

- **Scareware:** fake pop-up messages informing you that your system has been infected with malware and that you need to make a payment. These messages pose as security companies claiming to have detected malware. If you don't pay the ransom, you will probably have to get used to these messages.
- **Screen lockers:** you will not be able to use your computer at all. When you open your computer, you will see a full screen message asking you to make a payment. These messages might say they are from the FBI or Department of Justice so you can trust them. But the thing is, this is just a way of trying to persuade you to pay.
- **Encrypting Ransomware:** obtains and encrypts all your files, asking for payment in order to decrypt them and gain access to them again.
